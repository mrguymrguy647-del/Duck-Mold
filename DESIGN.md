# Duck Mold: design for Phase 0

**Status: approved and built.** This document says what Phase 0 is and
why, in plain words. It was written before any code, approved with five
decisions (section 16), and has been kept in step with what was built:
where the building changed a detail, the text here was changed to match,
and `PHASE0_REPORT.md` lists those changes.

Duck Mold turns a text file (a *recipe*) into a game-ready 3D model for
Duck Forge. It is an assembler, not a modelling program: you name parts,
say which socket joins which, pick colours from a palette, and it builds
the mesh. Phase 0 is the foundation: a library and a command-line program,
no window.

## 1. What I read first

The three sibling projects were not in folders next to this one, so I
made read-only copies from GitHub and read their READMEs, agent guides,
format documents and the relevant source. This is what I found and what
Duck Mold does with it.

| What the siblings do | Where | What Duck Mold does |
|---|---|---|
| A recipe is TOML in a file and JSON in a tool call: one set of fields, two ways to write it. `version = 0` is required. A misspelt field is an error, never ignored. | Duck Echo | The same. |
| A problem is data: a code, the field's path, the line, what was allowed, and a suggestion. With `--json`, exactly one JSON document is printed, failures included. | Duck Echo | The same shape, plus the file name. |
| Exit code 0 when it worked, 1 when the recipe is wrong, 2 for a wrong command line or a file that can't be read or written. | Duck Echo | The same. |
| A palette is a list of names with `"#RRGGBB"` colours. Things are defined once (`define`) and used many times (`use`). Any item may carry a `note` for people. Angles are degrees. Fields are spelt `color`; the documents say "colour". | Duck Quill | The same. |
| x is right, y is up, z is forward. 1 unit is about a metre. Built-in shapes are 1 unit big and centred. A transform scales, then rotates around x, then y, then z, then moves. | Duck Forge | The same, to the letter (section 3). |
| A mesh is triangles, **each with one flat colour**, lit evenly (flat shading). One texture per mesh at most. A triangle's corners go clockwise seen from the front. | Duck Forge | This decides how colour is exported (section 7). |
| Few dependencies, each one justified. No `unsafe`. Docs: a README for people, `docs/AI_GUIDE.md` for agents, decisions explained in plain words. | all three | The same. |

Two things I did not expect:

1. **Duck Forge cannot load model files yet.** Its guide says "no model
   files (build shapes in code, or merge the built-in ones)", and its
   Phase 3 design lists "3D model files (OBJ, glTF)" under *left out on
   purpose*. So there is no glTF import to check against. Section 8 says
   what was done instead: a `.glb` kept so simple that Duck Forge can
   read it with what it already has, and a tested reader to prove it.
2. **None of the three projects has a licence.** There is nothing to
   match. See decision 3 in section 16.

## 2. The idea in one picture

```
 robot.toml  (or robot.json)            the recipe: the source of truth
      │
      ▼
 read and check      every mistake at once, each with file, line, field, fix
      │
      ▼
 build the parts     boxes, cylinders, spheres, cones, wedges, imported meshes
      │
      ▼
 assemble            join sockets by name; nested assemblies become one tree
      │
      ▼
 colour              every face gets one colour from the palette
      │
      ├──►  duck-mold export   →  robot.glb    (for Duck Forge and any 3D viewer)
      └──►  duck-mold inspect  →  size, triangles, parts, floating, overlaps, ground
```

The mesh is never edited and never stored as a source. It is rebuilt
from the recipe every time, and the same recipe always gives the same
bytes (section 11).

Four words carry the whole design:

- **Part**: a thing in the model. A box, a cylinder, an imported mesh, or
  an assembly of other parts.
- **Socket**: a named point on a part, with a direction. Parts are joined
  socket to socket.
- **Palette**: the model's short list of named colours.
- **Recipe**: the file that lists the palette and the parts.

---

## 3. Directions, units and angles

These match Duck Forge exactly, so a number in a recipe means the same as
the number in game code.

- **x is right, y is up, z is forward.** 1 unit is about a metre.
- **A model faces forward (+z).** Its `front` is the +z side, `back` is
  -z, `left` is -x, `right` is +x, `top` is +y, `bottom` is -y. Left and
  right are the model's own left and right, and also yours when you stand
  behind it looking the way it faces.
- **Angles are degrees.** `rotate = [x, y, z]` turns around x, then y,
  then z, in Duck Forge's directions: a positive y angle turns forward
  towards the right. (Duck Forge's code uses radians; a recipe's
  `rotate = [0, 90, 0]` is `rotated(vec3(0.0, PI / 2.0, 0.0))` there.)
- **Order:** a part is mirrored, then scaled, then rotated, then moved.
  The last three are Duck Forge's `Transform` order.
- **The ground is y = 0.** By default a finished model stands on it
  (section 5, "Where the model's zero point is").

One note on the word "front". Duck Forge's cube code calls its -z face
"front" because that is the face a default camera sees. For a model with a
face and two arms, "front" has to be where it faces, or "left arm" would
mean two different things. I chose "a model faces forward", which is also
what glTF says. It is decision 1 in section 16, because every character
you ever make depends on it.

---

## 4. The recipe

A recipe is one file. TOML is the comfortable way to write it; JSON has
exactly the same fields and is handy for agents and tools. The file's
ending says which it is (`.toml` or `.json`).

### A first recipe

```toml
version = 0
name = "crate"

[palette]
wood  = "#B07A3F"
plank = "#8A5A2B"

[[parts]]
shape = "box"
size = [1, 1, 1]
color = "wood"
colors = { top = "plank", bottom = "plank" }
```

The same in JSON:

```json
{
  "version": 0,
  "name": "crate",
  "palette": { "wood": "#B07A3F", "plank": "#8A5A2B" },
  "parts": [
    { "shape": "box", "size": [1, 1, 1], "color": "wood",
      "colors": { "top": "plank", "bottom": "plank" } }
  ]
}
```

Both give the same `.glb`, byte for byte. A test holds that.

### A recipe with sockets

```toml
version = 0
name = "tree"

[palette]
bark = "#6B4A2B"
leaf = "#3F8F4A"

[[parts]]
name = "trunk"
shape = "cylinder"
radius = 0.15
height = 1.2
color = "bark"

[[parts]]
name = "leaves"
shape = "cone"
radius = 0.7
height = 1.6
color = "leaf"
attach = "bottom"       # my socket...
to = "trunk.top"        # ...joins this part's socket
```

No coordinates anywhere: the cone's `bottom` sits on the trunk's `top`.
Every part has those sockets built in.

### The top of the file

| Field | Needed? | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | yes | `0`. Any other number is refused with a clear message. |
| `name` | no | The model's name, for reports and inside the `.glb`. Default: the file's name without its ending. |
| `description` | no | A sentence for people and agents. |
| `note` | no | Anything for people. Ignored. (TOML also has `#` comments; JSON has none, so `note` is its comment.) |
| `palette` | no | The colours: a table of names, or the path of a palette file (section 6). |
| `define` | no | Parts defined once, to `use` many times. |
| `parts` | yes | The parts of the model, at least one. |
| `sockets` | no | Extra sockets on the whole model, for when another recipe uses this one as a part. |
| `origin` | no | Where the model's zero point is. Default `"bottom"`. |
| `bones`, `colliders`, `lods` | reserved | Not available yet (section 5, "Room for later"). Using one gives a clear "not yet" message, not "unknown field". |

### A part

Every entry of `parts`, and every entry of `define`, is a part. A part
gets its shape from **exactly one** of these four fields:

| Field | The part is... |
|---|---|
| `shape = "box"` | one of the five built-in shapes (table below) |
| `use = "leg"` | a copy of a part from `define` |
| `file = "wheel.toml"` | another recipe, or a mesh file (`.obj`; section 12). The path starts from the recipe's folder. |
| `parts = [ ... ]` | an assembly: a list of parts of its own (nesting) |

The other fields of a part:

| Field | What it is |
|---|---|
| `name` | What to call it: letters, digits, `_` and `-`. Needed if another part attaches to it. Names in one list must differ. An unnamed part is called by its place in the list, counting from 0 as error messages do: `#2` is `parts[2]`. |
| `color` | A palette name: the part's colour. |
| `colors` | Colours for single faces, by face name: `{ top = "grass" }`. |
| `attach`, `to` | Join my socket `attach` to the socket `to = "part.socket"` of another part in the same list. |
| `rotate` | With `attach`: one number, the degrees to twist the part around the join. Without `attach`: `[x, y, z]` degrees. |
| `move` | Without `attach`: `[x, y, z]`, where the part's centre goes. |
| `scale` | One number, or `[x, y, z]`. Must be above zero. |
| `mirror` | `"x"`, `"y"` or `"z"`: flips the part across that direction, sockets too. `mirror = "x"` turns a left arm into a right arm. |
| `sockets` | The part's own named sockets (section 5). |
| `note` | For people. Ignored. |
| `bones`, `colliders`, `lods` | Reserved, as above. |

A part is placed in one of two ways. With `attach` and `to` it goes where
the sockets say; `move` is refused (the message says to move the socket),
and `rotate` is one number that twists it around the join. Without them
it sits at the centre of its list, moved and turned by `move` and
`rotate = [x, y, z]`: the escape hatch for when you do want to type a
position. (`rotate` was two fields in the first draft, `turn` and
`rotate`; they became one name by decision 5. Writing the wrong form for
the part's kind is an error that shows the right one.)

### The five shapes

All are centred on their own middle, like Duck Forge's.

| `shape` | Size fields (default) | `segments` | Face names for `colors` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `box` | `size = [x, y, z]` (`[1, 1, 1]`) | none | `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `front`, `back`, and `sides` for the last four together |
| `cylinder` | `radius` (0.5), `height` (1). Stands upright. | 3 to 64 (16) | `top`, `bottom`, `side` |
| `sphere` | `radius` (0.5) | 4 to 64 (12) | `side` |
| `cone` | `radius` (0.5), `height` (1). Point at the top. | 3 to 64 (16) | `side`, `bottom` |
| `wedge` | `size = [x, y, z]` (`[1, 1, 1]`). A ramp: full height at the back, sloping down to the front edge. | none | `slope`, `bottom`, `back`, `left`, `right` |

`segments` is how many flat sides a round shape has: fewer is cheaper and
more angular. A box and a wedge are flat already, so they have none. Two
wedges back to back make a roof; a 4-sided cone is a pyramid.

Triangle counts are fixed and documented, so an agent can predict them: a
box is 12, a wedge 8, a cylinder `4 × segments - 4`, a cone
`2 × segments - 2`, a sphere `segments × (segments - 2)` for even counts.

### Mistakes

Every problem is reported at once, not only the first, each on one line:
the file, the line, the field, what is wrong, and a fix where one is
obvious.

```
error: robot.toml:12: define.arm.segments: 200 is too big. Allowed: 3 to 64.
error: robot.toml:31: parts[3].atach: there is no field "atach" here. Did you mean "attach"?
error: robot.toml:32: parts[3].to: the part "body" has no socket "nek". Did you mean "neck"?
error: robot.toml:40: parts[4].color: "#D0453A" is not a palette name. Add it to [palette] under a name (for example accent = "#D0453A") and write that name here.
warning: robot.toml:6: palette.rust: the colour "rust" is never used.
4 errors, 1 warning. Nothing was built.
```

They come file by file, from the top line down. When there is no
suggestion to make, the line ends with what is allowed instead
(`It can be: box, cylinder, sphere, cone, wedge.`).

Things that are errors: a syntax mistake, an unknown or misspelt field, a
missing or doubled field, a wrong kind of value, a number out of range, an
unknown shape, colour, part or socket, two parts with one name, a part
that uses itself (the message shows the chain: `arm > hand > arm`), both
`attach` and `move`, a file that isn't there. Things that are warnings (the
model is still built): a palette colour or a defined part never used, a
part with no colour, and what `inspect` finds (section 9).

---

## 5. Parts and sockets

### What a socket is

A socket is a point on a part with a direction it faces, like the stud on
a toy brick. Two sockets join **face to face**: the points meet and the
directions oppose, the way two magnets snap together.

**Every part has seven sockets built in**, on the box around it: `top`,
`bottom`, `left`, `right`, `front`, `back` (the middle of each side,
facing outwards) and `center`. For many models these are all you need.

A part can declare more, in one of three ways:

```toml
[parts.sockets]
neck     = { on = "top" }                              # the middle of a side
left_leg = { on = "bottom", shift = [-0.5, 0, 0] }     # slid halfway towards the left edge
hook     = { at = [0.2, 0.9, 0], facing = "front" }    # an exact point, in the part's own units
grip     = { from = "hand.bottom" }                    # a socket of a part inside this assembly
```

- `on` names a side of the box around the part. `shift` slides the socket
  across that side: each number goes from -1 (the left, bottom or back
  edge) to 1 (the right, top or front edge), so sockets keep their place
  when the part changes size. The number for the direction the side
  itself faces stays 0.
- `at` is the escape hatch: an exact position. `facing` is `up`, `down`,
  `left`, `right`, `front`, `back`, or a direction `[x, y, z]`.
- `from` passes on a socket of an inner part, so an assembly can offer
  "the hand's grip" without the outside knowing what is inside.

### How joining works

`attach = "bottom"`, `to = "trunk.top"` means: move and turn me so that
my `bottom` meets the trunk's `top`, facing it.

- **The part is turned as little as possible** to make the two sockets
  face each other. A head whose `bottom` faces down, joined to a body
  whose `neck` faces up, is not turned at all. That keeps a part's front
  to the front whenever it can.
- If the part has to turn right round (both sockets face the same way),
  it turns around the upright axis, so it stays the right way up. If the
  sockets face up or down, it rolls over sideways instead, so its front
  still faces front. One fixed rule, so the result never depends on luck.
- **`rotate`**, on a joined part, then twists it around the join by one
  number of degrees, clockwise when you look at the join from the side
  the other socket faces. For a socket that faces up, `rotate = 90` is
  the same turn as `rotate = [0, 90, 0]` on a free part.
- `mirror` and `scale` happen to the part first, sockets included, so a
  mirrored arm's shoulder socket is on its other side, ready to join.

Parts in one list form a tree: each attached part hangs from another. A
part that hangs from itself, directly or through others, is an error that
shows the chain.

### Nesting

An assembly is a part whose shape is a list of parts. Define it once and
use it like any other part:

```toml
[define.arm]                       # an assembly of two parts
[define.arm.sockets]
shoulder = { on = "right", shift = [0, 0.8, 0] }

[[define.arm.parts]]
name = "upper"
shape = "box"
size = [0.16, 0.6, 0.16]
color = "steel"

[[define.arm.parts]]
name = "hand"
shape = "sphere"
radius = 0.11
color = "red"
attach = "top"
to = "upper.bottom"

[[parts]]
name = "left_arm"
use = "arm"
attach = "shoulder"
to = "body.left_arm"

[[parts]]
name = "right_arm"
use = "arm"
mirror = "x"                       # the same arm, flipped
attach = "shoulder"
to = "body.right_arm"
```

Assemblies can hold assemblies, to any depth, and a whole recipe file can
be a part of another (`file = "wheel.toml"`), which is how a library of
parts grows. In reports, a part inside another is written with a slash:
`left_arm/hand`.

### Where the model's zero point is

A game places a model by its zero point. `origin` says where that is:

- `origin = "bottom"` (the default): the middle of the underside of the
  box around the whole model. The model stands on the ground, the way a
  Duck Quill sprite stands on its pivot.
- `origin = "trunk.bottom"`: a socket of one part. For a flag on a pole,
  that keeps the pole, not the flag, over the zero point.
- Any other built-in or declared socket of the model: `"center"`, `"top"`...

### Room for later: bones, colliders, LODs

You asked me to reserve room without building anything. Three things do
that:

1. **The names are taken.** `bones`, `colliders` and `lods` are reserved
   in every part and at the top of the file. Today they give a clear
   message (`"bones" is reserved for rigs and isn't available yet`), so no
   recipe can use them for something else, and no recipe silently carries
   data that does nothing. That is Duck Echo's rule: a field that exists,
   works.
2. **The assembly is kept, not flattened.** Inside the library the built
   model is a tree of placed parts, each with its name, its position and
   turn, its sockets and the triangles it owns. The triangle soup is made
   from that tree at the very end. A rig can later take a joint from
   every socket join, a collider can be fitted to each part's box, and a
   LOD can swap a part for a simpler one, all from data that is already
   there.
3. **The `.glb` remembers the parts.** It carries each part's name and
   which triangles are its own (section 8).

---

## 6. Colour in a recipe

```toml
[palette]
steel = "#8A939B"
red   = "#D0453A"
```

- A colour is `"#RRGGBB"` or `"#RGB"`. See-through colours (`#RRGGBBAA`)
  are refused in this phase with a "not yet" message.
- **A part's `color` must be a palette name.** A hex code there is an
  error that tells you to add it to the palette. That is what keeps "one
  small palette" true. A palette holds at most 256 colours.
- `color` paints the whole part. `colors` paints single faces by name and
  wins over `color`: `colors = { top = "grass", sides = "dirt" }`.
- On an assembly, `color` is the colour for everything inside that has
  none of its own. So a defined arm can fix its red hand and leave its
  body to whoever uses it: `use = "arm"`, `color = "gold"`.
- A face left with no colour at all is built in a plain grey, with a
  warning, so you can block a model out first and colour it after.
- **A shared palette.** `palette = "../palette.toml"` reads the names from
  a file (a plain list of `name = "#RRGGBB"`), so every model in a game
  can share one. I read your "one small shared palette" as both: all the
  parts of a model share it, and models can share one file. Colours from a
  shared file are not "never used" warnings.

---

## 7. How colour is stored and exported

**Decision: vertex colours, not a palette texture.**

Inside Duck Mold, every triangle remembers *which palette entry* it has
(a number), not a red-green-blue value. The colour is looked up at the
very end. When the model is written to a `.glb`, each corner of each
triangle gets its colour written next to its position (in glTF this is
called `COLOR_0`, a "vertex colour"). The three corners of a triangle
always carry the same colour, so the triangle is one flat colour.

The other way would be a palette texture: a tiny picture with one pixel
per palette colour, and for every corner a pair of numbers (a "UV") that
points at a pixel. Why I chose vertex colours:

1. **It is what a Duck Forge mesh is.** A Duck Forge triangle is three
   corners and one colour. Vertex colours turn into that directly. A
   palette texture would need Duck Forge to decode a picture from inside
   the file and look every triangle's colour up in it, to arrive at the
   same thing.
2. **No UVs in this phase.** A palette texture needs a UV on every
   corner. UVs are on your "not in this phase" list, and filling that
   slot now would be in the way when real textures come.
3. **One file, nothing to lose.** No picture inside or beside the model.
4. **Exact.** The colours that come out are the palette's colours, to the
   last digit (a test checks every palette colour survives the trip).

What a palette texture would have given, honestly: recolouring a model in
the game by swapping one small picture (team colours), and slightly
smaller files. The first is still possible: the palette is stored in the
`.glb` by name, so a loader can map colours back to names and swap them.
If that turns out to matter, adding a per-corner palette number is a
small, compatible addition later.

One technical detail, so it is on record: glTF wants vertex colours as
*linear* light, not the usual `#RRGGBB` numbers (sRGB). Duck Mold
converts on the way out with a fixed table of 256 numbers, so every
computer writes the same bytes, and other viewers show the right
colours. A reader converts back with the same table and gets the exact
palette values.

---

## 8. The `.glb` file, and what Duck Forge needs

A `.glb` is the one-file form of glTF 2.0, the common 3D format. Duck
Mold writes a deliberately narrow kind of it:

| | |
|---|---|
| Layout | One scene, one object (named after the recipe), one mesh, one list of triangles. Every part is merged into it, as Duck Forge's guide recommends ("one draw instead of dozens"). |
| Positions | `POSITION`: three decimal numbers per corner (32-bit). |
| Normals | `NORMAL`: which way each face points, the same for all corners of a face, so every viewer shades it flat like Duck Forge does. |
| Colours | `COLOR_0`: three decimal numbers per corner, linear. |
| Triangles | A list of corner numbers, always 32-bit. Faces do not share corners with other faces. |
| Material | One plain, matt material. No textures, no UVs. |
| Extras | Under `extras.duck_mold`: the format version, the recipe's name, the palette (names and `#RRGGBB`), and the list of parts with the triangles each one owns. Other programs ignore this; Duck tools read it. |
| Not written | Cameras, lights, animations, skins, textures, a date, your folder names. |

**Directions in the file.** glTF also says y is up and z is forward, but
its "right" is -x where Duck Forge's is +x (one is a left-handed system,
the other right-handed). So on the way out Duck Mold negates x and
reverses each triangle's corner order. Nothing is distorted: the model
faces forward in both, and its left arm is its left arm in both. A reader
for Duck Forge does the same two steps in reverse.

**What this means for Duck Forge.** Duck Forge has no loader, so "loads
in Duck Forge" needs something on its side. The file above can be read
with what Duck Forge already depends on (`serde_json`, which it uses for
sprite sheets): the format is a 12-byte header, a block of JSON and a
block of plain numbers. No new library, so Duck Forge's test that guards
its dependency list stays green.

In Phase 0:

1. The `.glb` is written as above and checked against the glTF rules in
   tests (required fields, sizes, alignment, bounds). The official
   Khronos glTF validator was also run on the five examples by hand: no
   errors, warnings, infos or hints.
2. A **small, separate reader**, `docs/forge/duck_mold_glb.rs`, turns a
   Duck Mold `.glb` into exactly what a Duck Forge `Mesh` holds: a list
   of points, and triangles with clockwise corners and a colour each. It
   uses only the standard library and `serde_json`, shares no code with
   the exporter (so a mistake in one cannot hide a mistake in the
   other), and is tested against all five examples. It is written to be
   copied into Duck Forge as `Mesh::load_glb`.
3. `docs/forge-handoff.md` lists exactly what a loader must support, for
   the session that adds one to Duck Forge.

Putting that reader into Duck Forge itself is a follow-up session in the
Duck Forge repository (decision 2): this one can only write to Duck
Mold.

---

## 9. The commands

The program is `duck-mold`. Three commands, plus help.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `duck-mold inspect <file> [--json]` | Checks and builds a recipe in memory and reports on it. Also takes an `.obj` mesh, or a `.glb` that Duck Mold wrote, to measure it as it is. Writes nothing. |
| `duck-mold export <recipe> [-o <file.glb>] [--json]` | Builds the recipe and writes the `.glb` (default: next to the recipe, same name). Ends with a one-line summary; `--json` gives the full inspect report. |
| `duck-mold guide` | Prints the agent guide, which is built into the program, so an agent with only the program can learn it. |
| `duck-mold help`, `--help`, `--version` | Every command; `duck-mold <command> --help` for one. |

There is no separate `check` command: a recipe with mistakes makes
`inspect` (and `export`) print the mistakes and stop with exit code 1, so
`inspect` *is* the check. One command fewer to learn.

**Exit codes:** 0 it worked (warnings included), 1 the recipe has
errors, 2 the command line was wrong or a file couldn't be read or
written.

**Where output goes:** reports go to standard output; problems written
for people go to standard error. With `--json`, standard output holds
exactly one JSON document, also when it failed.

### What `inspect` reports

For a robot with a box body and head, two box arms with red undersides
and two cylinder legs:

```
robot  (examples/robot.toml)
  size         1.02 wide x 1.65 tall x 0.40 deep, in metres (x, y, z)
  triangles    168  (288 corners)
  ground       rests on the ground
  colours      4:  steel 42, dark 120, red 4, glow 2  (triangles each)
  parts        6
    body         box              12 triangles
    head         box              12 triangles   on body.neck
    left_arm     arm (box)        12 triangles   on body.left_arm
    right_arm    arm (box)        12 triangles   on body.right_arm, mirrored
    left_leg     leg (cylinder)   60 triangles   on body.left_leg
    right_leg    leg (cylinder)   60 triangles   on body.right_leg

```

What each line means, exactly:

- **size**: the box around every corner of the model.
- **triangles**: how many, and how many corners are stored.
- **ground**: `rests on the ground` when the lowest point is within a
  millimetre of y = 0; otherwise `floats 0.25 above the ground` or `sinks
  0.10 into the ground`.
- **colours**: each palette colour used, with its triangle count.
- **parts**: the tree of parts, with what each is, its triangles, and
  what it is joined to.
- **floating**: parts that touch nothing. Two parts *touch* when their
  surfaces come within a millimetre. Starting from the first part,
  everything reachable by touching is the body; a part outside it is
  floating, and the report says how far it is from the nearest part:
  `left_ear floats: 0.05 from head`.
- **overlapping**: pairs of parts where one pokes more than a millimetre
  into the other, with how deep: `leaves is 0.10 inside trunk`. Depth is
  measured at the corners and edge middles of each part, so it is a good
  estimate, not an exact volume. A part entirely inside another is called
  `hidden` and is a warning, since nobody will ever see it. Overlap is
  often meant (a nose pushed into a head), so it is reported as a fact,
  not a mistake.

Floating parts, hidden parts and a model that does not rest on the ground
are warnings. They never change the exit code: the report is the check,
and an agent reads the fields.

## 10. The JSON output

`--json` prints one document. For `inspect` on the same robot (two of
its six parts shown here, to keep the example short):

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "summary": "robot: 1.02 x 1.65 x 0.40 m, 168 triangles, 6 parts, 4 colours, rests on the ground, nothing floating, nothing overlapping",
  "source": "examples/robot.toml",
  "name": "robot",
  "size": [1.02, 1.65, 0.4],
  "bounds": { "min": [-0.51, 0.0, -0.2], "max": [0.51, 1.65, 0.2] },
  "triangles": 168,
  "vertices": 288,
  "ground": { "rests_on_ground": true, "lowest_y": 0.0 },
  "palette": [
    { "name": "steel", "hex": "#8A939B", "triangles": 42 },
    { "name": "dark",  "hex": "#3B4148", "triangles": 120 },
    { "name": "red",   "hex": "#D0453A", "triangles": 4 },
    { "name": "glow",  "hex": "#FFE08A", "triangles": 2 }
  ],
  "parts": [
    { "name": "body", "kind": "box", "triangles": 12,
      "size": [0.7, 0.8, 0.4],
      "bounds": { "min": [-0.35, 0.5, -0.2], "max": [0.35, 1.3, 0.2] },
      "colors": ["steel"], "attached_to": null, "parts": [] },
    { "name": "left_arm", "kind": "box", "uses": "arm", "triangles": 12,
      "size": [0.16, 0.6, 0.16],
      "bounds": { "min": [-0.51, 0.63, -0.08], "max": [-0.35, 1.23, 0.08] },
      "colors": ["steel", "red"], "attached_to": "body.left_arm", "parts": [] }
  ],
  "floating": [],
  "overlapping": [],
  "warnings": [],
  "errors": []
}
```

- `summary` comes first and says the whole report in one line, as Duck
  Echo's `analyze` does.
- All lengths are metres; `size` and every point are `[x, y, z]`.
- `floating` entries: `{ "part": "left_ear", "nearest": "head", "gap": 0.05 }`.
- `overlapping` entries: `{ "a": "leaves", "b": "trunk", "depth": 0.1, "hidden": false }`.
- `export --json` prints the same report plus `"output": "robot.glb"`
  and `"bytes"`.
- A part's `kind` is what it is made of: `box`, `cylinder`, `sphere`,
  `cone`, `wedge`, `assembly` (a part made of parts) or `mesh`. `uses`
  names the defined part it came from and `file` the file, when there is
  one. `mirrored` appears when it is true.
- Every palette colour is listed, with 0 triangles if nothing uses it.
  `unpainted_triangles` appears when some faces have no colour.
- For an `.obj` or a Duck Mold `.glb` the report has the same fields. A
  `.glb` gives its parts as a flat list; an `.obj` is one part, and the
  report adds `materials`, the file's material names with their triangle
  counts.

When the recipe has mistakes:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "severity": "error",
      "code": "unknown_field",
      "file": "robot.toml",
      "line": 31,
      "column": 1,
      "path": "parts[3].atach",
      "message": "there is no field \"atach\" here",
      "got": "atach",
      "allowed": { "options": ["name", "shape", "use", "file", "parts", "size", "radius", "height", "segments", "color", "colors", "attach", "to", "rotate", "move", "scale", "mirror", "sockets", "note"] },
      "suggestion": "attach"
    }
  ],
  "warnings": []
}
```

This is Duck Echo's issue format with `file` added. `code` is a short
fixed word an agent can act on: `syntax`, `unknown_field`,
`missing_field`, `type_mismatch`, `out_of_range`, `unsupported_version`,
`unknown_shape`, `unknown_color`, `unknown_part`, `unknown_socket`,
`unknown_face`, `duplicate_name`, `conflict`, `cycle`, `reserved`,
`unsupported`, `file_not_found`, `bad_mesh`, `io`; and for warnings
`unused`, `no_color`, `floating`, `hidden`, `off_ground`, `skipped`. The
first six are Duck Echo's own names. `allowed` is either `options` or a
`min` and `max`. `docs/AI_GUIDE.md`, section 8, says what to do about
each.

---

## 11. The same recipe, the same bytes

This is rule 1, and it needs care in a few places:

- **No luck.** No random numbers, no clock, no reading of the computer's
  settings. The file holds no date and no folder names.
- **Its own sine and cosine.** The maths that the operating system
  supplies can differ in the last digit between Windows, Linux and Mac.
  Duck Echo avoids it for sound; Duck Mold does the same for shapes, with
  a small sine and cosine of its own built from plain arithmetic. A
  quarter turn is exact: turning by 90 degrees gives exactly 0 and 1, not
  0.00000004.
- **Order is the file's order.** Parts, palette entries and definitions
  are handled in the order they are written, never in the order of a
  hash table.
- **Tidy numbers.** Positions are worked out with double precision,
  rounded to a thousandth of a millimetre, and then stored. That removes
  noise like `-0.0000001` where 0 was meant.
- **Tests that hold it.** Section 14.

---

## 12. Importing meshes (OBJ), last

A part can take its shape from a file, and is then a static part like any
other: it has the seven built-in sockets, can declare more, and can be
scaled, mirrored, attached and coloured.

```toml
[[parts]]
name = "rock"
file = "models/rock.obj"
scale = 0.01                          # this file was made in centimetres
color = "stone"
colors = { Moss = "leaf" }            # a material name in the file -> a palette colour
attach = "bottom"
to = "ground.top"
```

- **Colour** still comes from the palette. `color` paints it all; in
  `colors`, the "face names" are the file's material names. The file's
  own colours and textures are not used. `duck-mold inspect rock.obj`
  lists the material names, the size and the triangle count, so you know
  what to write.
- **OBJ:** points and faces (faces with more than three corners are cut
  into triangles), material names. Normals, texture coordinates and the
  material file are passed over; lines and curves are skipped with a
  note. A mistake in the file is reported with the mesh file's own name
  and line.
- **Directions:** a file is read as glTF means them (y up, facing +z,
  right-handed), which is also what Blender writes for OBJ by default.
  For a file made another way, `rotate` and `scale` on the part fix it.
- The recipe plus the file it names are the source of truth together. The
  same two always give the same output.

**glTF import moved to Phase 1** (decision 4). The first draft of this
section planned both formats and advised keeping OBJ and letting glTF go
first if time ran short. OBJ is small and well defined; glTF has many
ways to store the same numbers, and reading other programs' files is
where the time goes. What Phase 0 does read is its own `.glb`, for
`inspect`. A `.glb` or `.gltf` named in a recipe gets a clear "not yet"
message that suggests saving the mesh as `.obj`.

```

Two crates, as you asked: the library does the work and knows nothing
about the command line, so a GUI or an MCP server can sit on the same
library later, as Duck Echo's does.

Rust edition 2024, like Duck Forge and Duck Quill. `unsafe` is forbidden
and every public item must have a comment, as in Duck Echo.

**Dependencies, and why each is there:**

| Crate | Used by | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `toml` | core | Reads TOML and tells me where every field is, for line numbers. |
| `serde`, `serde_json` | core | Writes JSON (reports, and the JSON block inside a `.glb`) and reads glTF. |
| `clap` | cli | Reads the command line and writes `--help` from the same comments, so help can't drift from what the program does. Duck Echo uses it too. |

That is all. Things written here rather than imported, because each is
small and the wording or the bytes matter: the JSON reader for recipes
(so JSON recipes get line numbers too, which `serde_json` cannot give),
"did you mean" suggestions, the `.glb` writer and reader, and the OBJ
reader.

---

## 14. Tests and the quality bar

- **Every step has tests**, written with that step and committed with it.
- **Golden files.** Each of the five examples has its `.glb` and its
  `inspect --json` report stored in `tests/golden/`. A test runs the
  real program, rebuilds them and compares every byte. If one changes,
  the test fails and shows what changed; a change that is meant is
  accepted with `DUCK_MOLD_ACCEPT=1 cargo test -p duck-mold-cli --test
  golden`, and the commit says why.
- **Same in, same out.** Building twice gives the same bytes; the TOML
  and JSON forms of one recipe give the same bytes.
- **Mistakes are tested too.** Each kind of error has a test for its
  file, line, field and suggestion.
- **The Duck Forge reader** (section 8) reads every golden `.glb` and
  must find the same triangles and exact palette colours.
- **The documents are tested.** The first recipe in the agent guide and
  in the README must build to exactly the report printed beside it, and
  every field the guide lists must be one the program knows.
- **Shapes face outwards.** The same test Duck Forge has for its own
  meshes, for every shape and every example.
- `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` with warnings as errors, clean at every
  commit.
- One commit per step, in your order: workspace, recipes, shapes, parts
  and sockets, colour, export, inspect, import; then the examples, the
  documents, and the report.

---

## 15. Left out on purpose

Besides your list (GUI, rendering, booleans, rigging, animation, UVs,
texture painting, sculpting), these are left out of Phase 0. Each is a
candidate for later, and none needs a change to what is designed here:

- **Importing glTF** (section 12).
- **Sockets in the `.glb`**, so a game can put a hat on a head at run
  time. A natural next step, as named empty points.
- **Mirror copies** (one line that makes both arms). In Phase 0 `mirror`
  flips a part; you write the second arm as a second part.
- **Swapping colours on a used part** by name, as Duck Quill's `use` can.
- **Smooth shading.** Duck Forge is flat-shaded, so Duck Mold is too.
- **See-through and glowing colours.**
- **A JSON Schema** command, as Duck Echo has. The guide and the error
  messages cover it for now.
- **A warning for two faces in the same plane** that would flicker.
- **An MCP server.** The library is shaped so one can be added.

---

## 16. The decisions

Before any code was written, this document ended with five questions.
These are the answers that were given, and what each led to.

1. **Which way does a model face?** *Forward, +z.* `front` is +z and
   `left` is the model's own left, -x (section 3). The comment in Duck
   Forge's cube that calls its -z face "front" disagrees in wording
   only; `PHASE0_REPORT.md` and `docs/forge-handoff.md` note it for the
   Duck Forge session to fix.
2. **The Duck Forge side.** *A follow-up session in the Duck Forge
   repository.* Phase 0 gives it a tested reader
   (`docs/forge/duck_mold_glb.rs`) and a short note of exactly what the
   loader must support (`docs/forge-handoff.md`).
3. **Licence.** *Left out for now*, like the three sibling projects; to
   be decided for the whole suite at once.
4. **Importing glTF.** *OBJ stays in Phase 0; glTF import moves to
   Phase 1* (section 12).
5. **The names.** *`turn` became `rotate`; the rest stayed.* One field,
   `rotate`, is a single number on an attached part and `[x, y, z]` on a
   free one (section 4).
